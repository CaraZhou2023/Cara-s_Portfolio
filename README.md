## 1. Analysis of the Visual Style Impact on Pets Donation’s Willingness | April 2024
This project is to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual styles of emails for animal shelter donations and provide insights for animal shelter's marketing strategies.

- Tools & Skills:
  - R, Qualtrics, Survey Design, A/B Testing

- Responsiblities:
  - Designed and distributed surveys using Qualtrics, setting a randomizer to compare the performance of two types of email.
  - Cleaned survey data in R; Excluded 15% invalid results based on EDA to ensure accuracy for analysis.
  - Conducted statistical data analysis (T-test and Two-way ANOVA) to verify the impacts of independent variables and moderators.
  - Conducted a power analysis to compute required sample size for a significant (α=.05) result.
- Achievements/Findings:
  - NO significant difference between the visual effects of emails on willingness to donate.
  - Discovered a significant impact of the pet ownership of participants on their willingness to donate; Collaboration with pet supply stores and veterinary hospitals might contribute to more donation.
