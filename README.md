## [2. \[Python\] Assessing Operating Profitability's Influence on Excess Returns Across Firm Sizes](https://github.com/CaraZhou2023/op-profitability-firm-size.git) | April 2024
The goal is to testify whether OP (Operating Profitability) is a powerful explaining factor for excess return of the stock market across firm sizes and compare our results to the bivariate-sort portfolios with the same factors from Kenneth R. French website.

- Tools & Skills: Python, Excel (Visualization)

- Achievements/Findings:
  - The average excess returns increase with the growth of OP, this trend is consistent across size categories.
  - High OP portfolios tend to perform better when value stocks outperform growth stocks
  - The portfolios with large-size companies with show the least variance with lower returns.

*In the table, the OP1 represents the portfolio groups with lowest OP values and OP5 with the highest. The same rule applies to the size (ME) grouping. The “Trends” column is the line charts of the excess average return for OP1-OP5 for each size group. The “L-S” represents long-short portfolios.*
